      <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by
        Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text
        files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use
        the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this
        website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored
        there. In the event that IP anonymization is activated on this website,
        however, your IP address will be truncated beforehand by Google within
        member states of the European Union or in other contracting states to
        the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases
        will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA
        and shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of
        evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website
        activity for website operators and providing other services relating to
        website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this
        information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where
        such third parties process the information on Google's behalf. The IP
        address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not
        be merged with other data from Google.

        By using this website you consent to the processing of data about you by
        Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.
